### An Ai Accelerated Laptop Watcher Thingy


So How does it work?
> Uses Apple's Beautiful CoreML tool and Python's amazing Open-CV to see if your precious laptop gets picked up or tampered with when you're out and about...peeing

Then
> Notifies by either sending a message though discord webhook or screams at the intruder. 


*Could be useful in school library or something? :)*
